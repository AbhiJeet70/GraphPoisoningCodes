# GraphPoisoningCodes- GPC

These notebooks carries demonstration of classification accuracies of Graph Neural Networks against different types of poisoning technique with Planetoid (Cora, Pubmed and CiteSeer) and Airports (USA, Brazil and Europe) pyg datasets. With the number technique, equal number of edges will be perturbed from nodes of a graph for a specific percentage of perturbations where with the percentage technique equal percentage of edges will be perturbed. Meta learning technique for GNN adversary has also been tried with both the datasets.
